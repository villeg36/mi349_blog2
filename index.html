          <p>World of Warcraft, also abbreviated as WoW, is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. The player can choose from a variety of different classes and, once created, the player is let loose into an open world, to explore and level at their leisure. The game build up a large sense of community with groups that can be formed known as guilds. Players must level from 1-60 as their most linear experience the game has to offer. This process can be completed by means of questing or putting together a group of 5 and doing activeties known as dungeons. For these activities, the player must set up the group of 5 to be balanced with other players that opperate as healers, tanks, and players capable of doing damage. It is this trifecta that will allow for the group to progress through these types of activities as they level, thus making the dungeons harder. Players will eventually gear up and have a character they can feel proud of, and can call their own. </p>

          <p>Once players get to 60, they will be exposed to the end game content known as raiding. Like dungeons, it is an instanced zone with iconic loot drops from the respecitve bosses. But raids are amped up to 11. These require 40 people to be coordinated to achieve success. Similarly, they composition of players still must be relatively balanced for the highest chances of success. </p>

          <h3>Why do Statistics Matter?</h3>
          <p> With most of what i mentioned above, you are probably thinking, " WoW seems more of a game that is interested in its online social or cultural element as opposed to anything Statistics related. So far, you would be right. But with the last but i mentioned in the blog post above, the high-end content for people to enjoy is raiding. This is where an emphasis on statistics comes into play. Getting a group of 40 players is already a gigantic task. As a result of that, you could imagine just how hard it could be if those 40 people arent all on the same page as yourself. By this I mean to say, you all need to be at least a little savvy in how your class operates and what you need to get the job done. In my case, I play a warrior. this means that if i want to output damage for my team, I must be stacking stats like 'critical strike chance' and 'Attack Power' to maximize my output for the raid. By doing this, you make the content a little easier to get through. Because as much as challenges are fun, a group of 40 people dont want to make 0 progress in a high stakes activity.</p>

          <p> Below, I will provide a table of data to explain some niche things about critical strike chance and hit chance</p>
          <table> 
            <tr> 
            <th> Damage mitigation against opponent </th>
            <th> Weapon skill+hit chance</th>
            <th> percent of attacks that cannot be a critical </th>
          </tr>

          <tr> 
            <td> 70% </td>
            <td> 300 weapon skill w/o hit cap</td>
            <td> 1 </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td> 0%</td>
            <td> 315 weapon skill, w/ hit cap</td>
            <td> 2 </td>
          </tr>

          <tr> <td> 40%</td>
            <td> reguardless of weapon skill or hit chance</td>
            <td> 3 </td>

          </tr>

          </table>
