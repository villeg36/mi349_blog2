            <h2>Why do Statistics Matter?</h2>
            <p class="position"> This is a test to see just how far the limits of flex box can be pushed. This middle column seems to fair just fine as far as readability goes. But for some reason the space alloted for the other columns is too small to read for any visitor.  </p>

        <p> The next couple of paragraphs, are only meant to take up space as a means to show that the title of the web page uses the sticky positioning. The page was otherwise not long enough to show this. And I removed the content previous as I was having format issues when it came to the flex box. I wiped many things clean from the page to get a better trouble shoot my problem. It seems I still have alignment problems with the middle and right columns, but this it far easier to read than what I had working before</p>
